OMAP2+ McSPI device

Required properties:
- compatible :
  - "ti,omap2-spi" for OMAP2 & OMAP3.
  - "ti,omap4-spi" for OMAP4+.
- ti,spi-num-cs : Number of chipselect supported  by the instance.
- ti,hwmods: Name of the hwmod associated to the McSPI
- ti,pindir-d0-out-d1-in: Select the D0 pin as output and D1 as
			  input. The default is D0 as input and
			  D1 as output.

SPI Controller specific data in SPI slave nodes:

- The spi slave nodes can provide the following information which is used
  by the spi controller.

- ti,spi-cs-per-word: Set chipselect to be toggled on every word send.

- ti,spi-turbo-mode: Set turbo mode for this device.


Example:

- SoC Specific Portion:

mcspi1: mcspi@1 {
    #address-cells = <1>;
    #size-cells = <0>;
    compatible = "ti,omap4-mcspi";
    ti,hwmods = "mcspi1";
    ti,spi-num-cs = <4>;
};

- Board Specific Portion:

	spi-device@0 {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;

		controller-data {
			ti,spi-cs-per-word = <1>;
			ti,spi-turbo-mode = <0>;
		};
	};
